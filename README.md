# Neighbourhood-Map-Udacity
This is the last and final project in the udacity front End Nano Degree Program. The Neighbourhood Map project involves developing a single page application with the KnockoutJS framework and various API's. Aside from the Google Maps API, additional information is added to the project locations with the FourSquare API loaded asynchronously. KnockoutJS allows the project to be organized with the MVVM pattern, so that the page can be loaded without getting refreshed.
